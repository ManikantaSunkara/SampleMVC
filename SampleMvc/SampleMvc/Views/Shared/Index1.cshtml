<h1>ASP.NET</h1>
<p>
    .NET is a developer platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.
    The base platform provides components that apply to all different types of apps. Additional frameworks, such as ASP.NET, extend .NET with components for building specific types of apps.
    When using ASP.NET your back-end code, such as business logic and data access, is written using C#, F#, or Visual Basic.
    Because ASP.NET extends .NET, you can use the large ecosystem of packages and libraries available to all .NET developers. You can also author your own libraries that are shared between any applications written on the .NET platform.
